# Adding a New Tool
To add a new tool to this repository, create a new folder/file in this directory with the name of the tool and a brief description of what it does.

For example, if you want to add a tool called "New Tool", create a folder called `New Tool` with the following format:
./New Tool
main.py     -- the source code of the file.
...         -- files of your tool.
...         -- files of your tool.
README.md   -- make sure you have the README.md which include the basic readme for a tool/project.

in main README.md you don't need to edit the README.md file/ or just add your toolname and description on the tools list. example:
```
### New Tool
A brief description of what the tool does.
```

Once you've created the file/folder, submit a pull request to have it added to the main repository.
